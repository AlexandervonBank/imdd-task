  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) emulated on dedicated
  neuromorphic accelerators promise to offer
  energy-efficient signal processing. However, the
  neuromorphic advantage over traditional algorithms still
  remains to be demonstrated in real-world applications.
  Here, we describe an intensity-modulation,
  direct-detection (IM/DD) task that is relevant to
  high-speed optical communication systems used in data
  centers. Compared to other machine learning-inspired
  benchmarks, the task offers several advantages. First, the
  dataset is inherently time-dependent, i.e., there is a
  time dimension that can be natively mapped to the dynamic
  evolution of SNNs. Second, small-scale SNNs can achieve
  the target accuracy required by technical communication
  standards. Third, due to the small scale and the defined
  target accuracy, the task facilitates the optimization for
  real-world aspects, such as energy efficiency, resource
  requirements, and system complexity.
